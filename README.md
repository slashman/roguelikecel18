# Roguelike Celebration 2018 Trailer

# Setup
You'll need to install a few things before you have a working copy of the project.

## Install node.js and npm:

https://nodejs.org/en/


## Install dependencies

Navigate to the cloned repo's directory.

Run:

```npm install``` 

## Run the development server:

Run:

```npm run dev```

This will run a server so you can run the game in a browser. It will also start a watch process, so you can change the source and the process will recompile and refresh the browser automatically.

To run the game, open your browser and enter http://localhost:3000 into the address bar.


## Build for deployment:

Run:

```npm run deploy```

This will optimize and minimize the compiled bundle.
